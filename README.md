## About Me

Hi — I’m Chen, a Statistics and Computer Science student at Purdue.

I’m focused on building a strong foundation in math, programming, and machine learning. My work is driven by clarity — in how I think, what I build, and how systems connect beneath the surface.

I approach learning by doing: solving problems, exploring data, and writing code that’s simple, efficient, and built to last.
