## About Me

Hi, I’m Chen! I'm a Statistics and Computer Science student at Purdue.

Right now I'm focusing on building a strong foundation in math, programming, and machine learning.

I approach learning by doing: solving problems, exploring data, and writing code that’s simple, efficient, and built to last.
