## About Me

Hi — I’m Chen, a Statistics and Computer Science student at Purdue University.

I’m currently focused on building a strong foundation in math, programming, and machine learning. I care about clarity — in thought, in code, and in systems. Most of my work revolves around understanding how things fit together beneath the surface, whether that’s in a dataset, an algorithm, or a proof.

I'm learning by doing: solving problems, exploring real-world data, and refining how I think through code.
